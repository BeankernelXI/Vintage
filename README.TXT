Vintage is a vi editing package for Sublime Text 2 - http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/vintage.html

Vintage is shipped by default with Sublime Text 2. To use this development version instead of the default one, you should:

1. Ensure the inbuilt Vintage package is in the ignored_packages list, as it is by default.

2. Clone this repository to a separate directory under your Packages path, such as "Vintage Dev". e.g., on OS X, you could do:

cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/
git clone git@github.com:sublimehq/Vintage.git "Vintage Dev"
